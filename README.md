About this Collection
=====================

As a python developer, if I try to identify what really helped me to have a better grasp at the language when I initially started exploring python, then playing around with the source code from from various small projects would definitely be on the top of the list. The more simple and readable the program, the easier it becomes to get a hold of what's really happening and make adjustments as needed.

To help others down the same path, I'm creating a collection of these example programs which have minimum or no dependencies, aimed at being easy to copy and understand by beginners. These programs have the following constraints:

* They're short programs, with a soft limit of 256 lines of code and fit into a single source code file and don't need any installer. *This makes them easy to read and understand in one sitting. The shorter the better.*
* **Elegant** and **efficient** code is worthless next to code that is **easy to understand** and **readable**. *These programs are for education, not production. Standard best practices, like not using global variables, can be ignored to make it easier to understand.*
* All functions have docstrings. *This is good documentation practice, but also enables the `help()` function to work in the interactive shell.*
