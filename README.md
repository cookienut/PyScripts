About this Collection
=====================

When I started exploring python initially, the thing that definitely helped me to get a better grasp of the language was playing around with the source code of various other small projects. The more simple and readable the program, the easier it becomes to get a hold of what's really happening and make adjustments as required.

So, in order to help others down the same path, I'm creating a collection of these example programs which have minimum or no dependencies, aimed at being easy to copy and understand by beginners.

**Note:**
- These are short programs (usually having less than 300 lines of code and a single file) to keep them readable and easy to understand.
- These programs are for education, not production. Standard best practices, like not using global variables, may have been ignored at some places to keep it easier to understand. At some places I might have suppressed linting exceptions as well, for the same reason. At the same time, the practices used in the programs (docstrings and PEP8 guidelines) are good enough for a beginner to start with.
